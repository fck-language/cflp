# Getting started

To start, make sure you've added the library to your `Cargo.toml` file

```toml
cflp = "0.1"
```

You then get access to the `rule!` macro. This is the main part of this crate and has the following syntax

```rust
rule!(
    (
        <type vis>, <iter item>, <comp item>,
        <map function>, (<derived trait 1>, <derived trait 2>, ...)
    )
    (rule_name_1; <rule_tokens>)
    (rule_name_2; <rule_tokens>)
    // ...
);
```

where:
- `<type vis>` is the visibility for the generated types
- `<iter item>` is the input type. Each parser function takes in a `&mut T: Iterator<Item=&E>` where `E` is the iterator item
- `<comp item>` is the type that will be compared to the `<iter item>`
- `<map function>` is a function that takes in `&<iter type>` and returns a `<comp type>`. This is required when comparing `Option<&<iter type>>` to `<comp type>`
- The last section is a list of derived traits you want every generated type to have. This is optional
