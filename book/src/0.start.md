# Getting started

Welcome to the cflp book. This is to teach you how to use cflp and contains some [benchmarks](https://fck-language.github.io/cflp/bench/report) (More on that [later](./4.benchmarks.md))

---

To start, make sure you've added the library to your `Cargo.toml` file

```toml
cflp = "1.0"
```

## Overview

cflp allows you to derive a parser trait with a derive macro and helper attributes. The macro can derive a context-free language (hence the name of the crate), but the trait can be used more generally if required.

When discussing the trait, we have two types to consider:

`I`: Input type

`C` : Comparison type

The parser takes an iterator over input tokens which are of type `I` and compares them to some instances of the type `C`. These may be the same type in simple instances, but for more complex uses will most likely be different types.

## Required impls

```rust
pub trait Parser<I, C, R = Self> where
    I: PartialEq<C>,
    C: PartialEq<C>
{
	fn parse<T>(src: &mut T) -> Result<R, Error<I, C>> where
        I: Iterator<Item=I> + Clone,
        Self: Sized;
}
```

When deriving the `Parser` trait, you will need to ensure that your input type `I` implements `PartialEq<C>` where `C` is your comparison type (this will make sense the more you read). You will also need to ensure that `C: PartialEq<C>`.

**IMPORTANT:**
If the input and comparison types are given as the same thing, deriving `PartialEq` on the input type will not cover the requirement `I: PartialEq<C>`. Since the input comes from an iterator, `I` will be a reference. If the input and comparison types are given as the same, then `I = &C`. In this case, you will need to impl `&C: PartialEq<C>`. You can use the `PartiqlEqRef` derive macro to derive a simple impl for this:

```rust
impl PartialEq<C> for &C {
    fn eq(&self, other: &C) -> bool {
        self == other
    }
}
```
