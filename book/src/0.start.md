# Getting started

Welcome to the cflp book. This is to teach you how to use cflp and contains some benchmarks [here](https://fck-language.github.io/cflp/bench/report/index.html).

To start, make sure you've added the library to your `Cargo.toml` file

```toml
cflp = "0.2"
```

## Overview

cflp allows you to derive a parser trait with a derive macro and helper attributes. when used with other input, cflp can derive a parser for a context-free language (hence the name of the crate).

## Required impls

```rust
pub trait Parser<I: PartialEq<C>, C: PartialEq<C>, R = Self> {
	fn parse<T: Iterator<Item=I> + Clone>(src: &mut T) -> Result<R, Error<I, C>> where Self: Sized;
}
```

When deriving the `Parser` trait, you will need to ensure that your input type `I` implements `PartialEq<C>` where `C` is your comparison type (this will make sense the more you read). You will also need to ensure that `C: PartialEq<C>`.\
This may just be deriving `PartialEq` is the types are the same, or a (hopefully) simple function if they're not.
