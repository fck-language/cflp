# Getting started

Welcome to the cflp book. This is to teach you how to use cflp and contains some benchmarks [here](https://fck-language.github.io/cflp/bench).

---

To start, make sure you've added the library to your `Cargo.toml` file

```toml
cflp = "0.1"
```

You then get access to the `rule!` macro. This is the main part of this crate and has the following syntax

```rust
rule!(
    (
        <type vis>, <iter item>, <comp item>,
        <map function>, (<derived trait 1>, <derived trait 2>, ...)
    )
    (rule_name_1; <rule_tokens>)
    (rule_name_2; <rule_tokens>)
    // ...
);
```

where:
- `<type vis>` is the visibility for the generated types
- `<iter item>` is the input type. Each parser function takes in a `&mut T: Iterator<Item=&E>` where `E` is the iterator item
- `<comp item>` is the type that will be compared to the `<iter item>`
- `<map function>` is a function that takes in `&<iter type>` and returns a `<comp type>`. This is required when comparing `Option<&<iter type>>` to `<comp type>`
- The last section is a list of derived traits you want every generated type to have. This is optional

## Required traits

There are two required traits for the iterator item `T` and comparison item `E`:
- `E: PartialEq<E>`
- `&T: PartialEq<E>`

If you have saving matches for whole tokens not the values of the token, then any derived traits will also need to be implemented for `T`. For example if you had a rule `[MyTokenType::MyVariant]` where one of your given derived traits was `Debug`, `MyTokenType` would also have to implement `Debug`
