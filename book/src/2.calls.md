# Calling other rules

A large part of context-free grammars is that any rule in the grammar can reference a rule defined in the grammar. To do this with the `rule!` macro, you just prefix the rule name with an `@` symbol.

For example, take the following macro

```rust
rule!(
    (pub(crate), Token, Token, |t| t.clone(), (Debug, Clone))
    (Root; Token::OP, [@Inner], Token::CP)
    (Inner; ([Token::Value; u8])*)
);
```

Some syntax here won't make sense, namely the square brackets which is discussed next, but the general idea can still be seen. The `Root` rule matches a `Token::OP` then matches the `Inner` struct, the matches a `Token::CP` struct.

## Calling hand-implemented rules

Any call to another rule is just a call to `RuleName::parse(src)`, meaning that if you have some data structure you've implemented `Parser` for with the same generics as the macro will implement, you can call that rule. For example, you may have a struct `MyStruct` that implements `Parser` with the same generics as the macro wil use. In that instance you could call `@MyStruct` from inside the rule macro, and it would use your struct and implementation of `Parser::parse`.
