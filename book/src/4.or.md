# Or closures

One part of CFLs is allowing multiple definitions of a rule. You can do this by giving multiple definitions of a rule like this
```rust
rule!(
    (/* ... */)
    (Rule; [Token::Value; u8]; [Token::Other; char])
);
```

If you do this, it means that `Rule` will be an enum not a struct, where the variants are named `Var` followed by the index that rule comes from. The above example would generate the type
```rust
enum Rule {
    Var1(u8),
    Var2(char)
}
```

The rule will be turned into an enum even if all the returned types from the match are the same.

## Custom names

You can give or match variants custom names. This is done by putting an identifier followed by the `=>` arrow before the rule. For example if you replaced the rule in the example above with 
```rust
(Rule; Value => [Token::Value, u8]); [Token::Other; char])
```
this would change the generated type to be
```rust
enum Rule {
    Value(u8),
    Var2(char)
}
```

## Errors

If an or rule fails to match any of the given rules, it will return an error. This error will be the error returned when parsing the first rule. For example, if we take the above rule and gave it `Token::OP`, the returned error would look like
```rust
cflp::Error {
    expected: Token::Value(0),
    found: Some(Token::OP)
}
```

If the value inside the `Token::Value` variant is confusing, see the previous chapter.
