# No type generation required

If you already have the types you want to use, you can either derive the `Parser` impl for the type or use the `rule_no_types!` macro.

## `rule_no_types!`

The `rule_no_types!` macro is exactly the same as the `rule!` macro without the requirement for the type visibility, and won't generate type.

For example the following two code blocks are equivalent

```rust
rule!(
	(pub(crate), Token, Token, |t| t.clone(), (Debug, Clone))
	(Root; Token::OP, ([@Expr])*, Token::CP)
	(Expr; Literal => [Token::Literal; u8]; [Token::Other; char])
);
```

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub(crate) struct Root(Expr);

#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub(crate) enum Expr {
    Literal(u8),
    Var2(char)
}

rule_no_types!(
	(Token, Token, |t| t.clone(), (Debug, Clone))
	(Root; Token::OP, ([@Expr])*, Token::CP)
	(Expr; Literal => [Token::Literal; u8]; [Token::Other; char])
);
```

This may be useful to you for additional type hints in an IDE or to see the types more easily.

## Attribute macro

An attribute macro is the other way you can derive the `Parser` impl from a rule. If you wanted to use this for the previous example, this is what you'd have

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
#[parser(Token, Token, |t| t.clone(); Token::OP, ([@Expr])*, Token::CP)]
pub(crate) struct Root(Expr);

#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
#[parser(
    Token, Token, |t| t.clone();
    [Token::Literal; u8];
    [Token::Other; char]
)]
pub(crate) enum Expr {
    Literal(u8),
    Var2(char)
}
```

An interesting thing you may have noticed is that the name for the first option of the `Expr` rule has gone. This is because the attribute will work out the intended name based on the order; first rule corresponds with the first variant and so on. Any given name will be ignored if given.

This approach means that whilst you do have to declare the same information for each macro (iter type, comparison type, and option map function), it allows the rules to be next to the corresponding types and allows or rule variant names to be easily altered.
