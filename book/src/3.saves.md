# Saving values

Parsing an input is slightly meaningless if you don't save any of the data you just matched. To do this, you can put values in square brackets to save them. This has two forms; a simple match, and an unwrapping match.

## Simple match

A simple match is one that just saves the value it matched. For example, you might have `[Token::OP]` to save a matched open parentheses. But what if the enum variant your matching has a value in it? In that case you just give the values you want to match, for example `[Token::Value(3)]`.

Simple matches are also where you match the results of other types. For example if you wanted to save the match returned by `MyRule`, you would have `[@MyRule]`.

## Unwrapping match

An unwrapping match allows you to save the values inside an enum variant. These look like `[Token::Value; u8]`. The general form is `[Enum variant; list of types inside the variant]`. The list of types can also include `_` if you don't want to save that value. If you had a variant `MyEnum::MyVariant(u8, u16)` and only wanted to save the `u16` when matching it, you would have `[MyEnum::MyVariant; _, u16]`.

When an unwrapping match fails, the returned error needs to give values for the matched values (for example `Token::Value` needs a `u8` for it to be valid). To do this the value uses `Default::default()`. In the example of `Token::Value` this means the returned token would be `Token::Value(0)`.

## Types

The types returned from matches depend on what you're matching surprisingly. The following list should explain all of the possible options:
- Simple match not a call - Match type
  `[Token::OP]` returns `Token`
- Simple match call - Call struct name
  `[@RuleName]` returns `RuleName`
- Unwrapping match - Defined by the given unwrapped values
  `[MyEnum::MyVariant; _, u16]` returns `u16`
  `[MyEnum::MyVariant; u8, _]` returns `u8`
  `[MyEnum::MyVariant; u8, u16]` returns `(u8, u16)`

When these are wrapped in groups with modifiers (option, Kleene, and positive closures), the types are changed (`T` here indicates the type returned by the inner group):
- Option returns `Option<T>`
- Kleene closure and positive closure return `Vec<T>`
