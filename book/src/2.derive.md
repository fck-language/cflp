# Derive macro

When using the derive macro to derive the `Parser` trait, you need to specify how the parser should be implemented. This is done using helper attributes (`#[parser(...)]`).

## Metadata

Metadata is just three arguments (two types and one expression) that are required to know how to derive the `Parser` impl. They're comma seperated (no trailing comma) and in the following order:
1. **Input token type**\
    This is the type in the iterator (behind a reference). For example if our input token type was `MyToken`, the iterator would be `T: Iterator<Item=&MyToken>`
2. **Comparison token type**\
    This is the type being compared with. If your input token type contains token metadata (such as token position), then you will probably want to compare the underlying token type. Using the example from before, if we had `MyToken::type_: MyTokType` where `MyTokType` is an enum of token types, we would probably have our comparison token type as `MyTokType`
3. **Function to convert the input to the comparison**\
   _This is only required if the input and comparison types are different_  
    This is needed to allow comparisons. Unfortunately, `Option<T>` doesn't implement `PartialEq<Option<M>>` even if `T: PartialEq<M>`, so when comparing the two we need to have some function to convert from the input to the comparison. In our example this would be `|t| t.type_`.

    _You may need add a type annotation for the argument sometimes. The compiler occasionally cannot work out what the type of the argument is so it will need specifying manually. The type should be a reference of the input type (`&MyToken` in our example)_

## Rule syntax

Rules are defined as two parts; values and groups. Values are singular expressions, and groups are a group of values.

### Values

Consider the following rule from one of the examples:
```rust
#[derive(Parser)]
#[parser(
    Token, TokType, |t| t.t;
    [@Expr], TokType::Plus, [[@Expr]]
)]
pub struct Add {
    pub left: Expr,
    pub right: Box<Expr>
}
```

The first line in the helper attribute (line 3) is the metadata. The line after defined the rule for the parser impl. We'll consider this in segments:
1. `[@Expr]`\
    This is a call to another rule, `Expr` in this case. The square brackets means that we save the result of this is it doesn't fail.
2. `TokType::Plus`\
    This matches one token with a `TokType::Plus`. If this matches the next element in the input, we keep going; otherwise we return an error.
3. `[[@Expr]]`\
    This is the same as the first match, but with two square brackets around it. This does the same as the first match, but boxes the result. This is sometimes required to ensure structs can't have infinite size

### Groups

A group is a set of values in parentheses. It can optionally be followed by a `?`, `*`, or `+` for an optional group, kleene closure, and positive closure:
- Optional means it will try to be parsed. If it's not, then it resets the input iterator back to where it was before the group, and skips it. This becomes an `Option<T>` where `T` is the type matched by the inside of the group
- Kleene closure means it matches any number (including zero) of the group. This becomes a `Vec<T>` where `T` is the type matched by the inside of the group
- Positive closure means it matches at least one of the group. This has the same type as a kleene closure

Take this from one of the examples:

```rust
#[derive(Parser)]
#[parser(Token, TokType, |t| t.t; ([@Add])*)]
pub struct Root(pub Vec<Add>);
```

This matches as many iterations of `Add` as can be parsed until it fails.

Groups can have comma seperated values. For example you could have `(TokType::Int(1), TokType::Add, TokType::Int(2))?` as a group. Groups can be nested

### Enums and unwrapping matches

Util now, all the examples have been on structs. Enums are slightly different. The enum needs the metadata in a parser attribute on the enum itself, with the rule for each enum variant in an parser attribute on the variant.

For example, we might have a simple enum to turn token literals into AST node literals

```rust
#[derive(Parser)]
#[parser(Token, TokType, |t| t.t)]
pub enum Literal {
    #[parser([TokType::Int(t)])]
    Int(u8),
    #[parser([TokType::char(t)])]
    Char(char)
}
```

You'll notice that the matches on the variants don't have literal values, but identifiers. This is because matches that aren't calls to other types are parsed as patterns, like in a match statement arm. The identifiers are matches just like in a match statement and used, instead of matching the whole token.

When picking identifiers, make sure they're all unique. It's also a good idea to avoid identifiers with a double underscore prefix such as `__my_var` since double underscore prefixed variables are used in the derived implementation and it may allow for things to get messed up.
