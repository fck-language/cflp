# Simple rules

Here we'll introduce simple rule syntax. This will include matching types, optional sections, Kleene closures, and positive closures.

We'll be using the following struct as our example token

```rust
pub enum Token {
    OB, CB,     // Opening and closing parenthesis
    Value(u8),  // A literal value
    Other(char) // Some character
}
```

## Matching something

If you want to match a token, add the token you want to match to the rule. Simple as that. For example if we wanted to match `Token::OB` in our rule, we'd have `(RuleName; Token::OB)`.

## Groups

A group is a set of rules inside some parentheses. These can be complex nested groups with lots of modifiers applied to each inner group, or just contain a single value such as `(Token::Value(2))`.

## Optional sections

An optional section is one that can optionally be included in the input. The parser is a maximal-munch parser and will always try to match these optional sections.

To indicate an optional section, you add a `?` to the end of a **group** for example `(Token::Other('a'))?`.

## Kleene and positive closures

A Kleene closure is one that will match the inner section 0 or more times, and a positive closure will match the inner section at least once. These are indicated in a similar way to optional sections but with a `*` for a Kleene closure and `+` for a positive closure.
