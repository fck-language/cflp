The focus of this crate is to provide parsing for context-free languages with a focus on speed and (obviously) correctness whilst placing as few restrictions as possible.

## State of the code

The code for the non-macro part of the library is pretty well documented and clean. The macro part of the lib is quite messy. It will be documented properly soon.
