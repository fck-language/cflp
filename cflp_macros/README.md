## A note to contributors

If you'd like to contribute to this project, I sincerely apologise for the state of the code in this crate. It spiralled quite quickly with "quick-fixes" piled on top of each other with little regard paid to what was being made and what it'd be like to deal with it when putting another "quick-fix" in. Sorry.

I'm trying to fix this slowly.
